# Project Title

## What you like about your implementation?
I like this component-based approach. I find it interesting when we build this kind of tool without relying on specific libraries.

## What you would change if you were going to do it again?
I might break it down into smaller files for better maintainability.

## How you made your design decisions. For example, if you looked at other timelines for inspiration, please note that.
I was actually inspired by Google Calendar, where everything is very elegant.

## How you would test this if you had more time.
I would test more scenarios, explore possibilities I hadn't thought of, look for other examples online, and use them for comparison.
